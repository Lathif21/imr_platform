# IMR Platform

One platform for the holding group's financial reporting **and** ILJ's
operational system: the IMR_keu reporting portal, extended with the modules
of the Laravel operational system (LaporanKeuangan) as they are ported.

**Start with [docs/PENGGABUNGAN.md](docs/PENGGABUNGAN.md)** — what was merged,
the decisions behind it, the port order, the data migration plan, and the
questions still open. Everything below describes the reporting portal this
platform was copied from, and still holds for it.

Local Supabase runs on ports **553xx** (`project_id = IMR_platform`), so it can
run beside IMR_keu's stack on 543xx. A fifth seed account,
`admin.ilj@example.test` (`admin_operasional`, ILJ only), exercises the
operational module.

Read these before writing code:

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| [docs/PENGGABUNGAN.md](docs/PENGGABUNGAN.md) | The merge: decisions, port plan, data migration, open questions. |
| [docs/CLAUDE.md](docs/CLAUDE.md) | Non-negotiable invariants. Violating one produces wrong reports. |
| [docs/CONTEXT.md](docs/CONTEXT.md) | Indonesian domain vocabulary. Mixing terms up has already produced wrong numbers once. |
| [docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md](docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md) | Accounting policies that are still undecided. The system surfaces them; it never picks a default. |
| [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) | What is still checked by hand, after `npm test`: session handling and the dashboard. |
| [docs/TESTING-WORKFLOW.md](docs/TESTING-WORKFLOW.md) | The two write screens, walked end to end. |
| [docs/TESTING-PHASE2.md](docs/TESTING-PHASE2.md) | Fase 2 on screen: the P&L report, entity isolation, and the ILJ import. |
| [docs/TESTING-INTEGRASI.md](docs/TESTING-INTEGRASI.md) | The operational system → portal pull, tested end to end on screen with Playwright. |
| [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) | Inspecting the schema in DBeaver: tables, relations, triggers, and why RLS looks absent there. |

## Stack

SvelteKit (SSR) + TypeScript · Neon (Postgres, Neon Auth, Data API, RLS) ·
Tailwind v4. `supabase-js` is called directly against the Neon Data API, which
speaks PostgREST — no ORM, no repository layer. Only its query half is used;
login and account administration go through `src/lib/server/neon-auth.ts`.

Production runs on the `imr_keu` database of the Neon project `IMR`. Neon Auth
keeps users in `neon_auth."user"`, and `auth.uid()` reads the JWT's `sub`
exactly as on Supabase, so the migrations and every RLS policy are shared by
both. Apply them to Neon with:

```sh
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... npx tsx scripts/neon-migrate.ts --bootstrap
```

The script rewrites the one Supabase-only reference (`auth.users`) on the fly
and records what it applied; `--bootstrap` adds the four entities and the
operational sync link from `supabase/neon-bootstrap.sql`.

## Running it locally

`npm run dev` talks to Neon, using `NEON_AUTH_BASE_URL` and
`NEON_DATA_API_URL` from `.env` (Neon Auth accepts `localhost` origins).

The test suite and the seeded accounts below still use a local Supabase stack,
which needs Node 20+, Docker Desktop, and the Supabase CLI.

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # fill in the keys `supabase start` prints
supabase start            # Postgres, Auth, Studio on 127.0.0.1
npm run db:reset          # apply migrations, then supabase/seed.sql
npm run dev
```

`supabase/seed.sql` creates four local accounts, one per role, all with the
password `devpassword`:

| Email | Role | Sees |
|---|---|---|
| `direksi@example.test` | direksi | everything; can unlock a locked period |
| `manajer@example.test` | manajer_keuangan | everything; approves and locks |
| `staf.ilj@example.test` | staf_entitas | ILJ only |
| `auditor@example.test` | auditor | everything, read-only |

These exist only in a local database. They are not printed anywhere in the UI.

## Security notes

Deliberate limitations, not oversights. Each is a decision that can be revisited
when the group is bigger than ten people.

**Accounts are created by a director, password and all.** There is no SMTP
configured, so `/admin/users` calls `createUser` with `email_confirm: true` —
without it the account could never log in. The consequences, in full:

- There is **no email verification**. An address is whatever the director typed.
- There is **no self-service password reset**. A forgotten password means asking
  a director to set a new one.
- The director **knows every initial password**. The screen offers a random
  generator and shows the result once, so nobody has to invent one, but the
  password still passes through a human.

Passwords are never written to a log, never stored in `audit_log`, never put in
an error message, and never sent back to the browser after being set. Minimum
length is checked on the server, not only in the form.

**Email cannot be changed** once an account exists. `auth.admin.updateUserById`
could do it, but changing someone's address without verification is how an
account gets taken over. Deactivate and create a new one instead.

**Nobody is ever deleted.** `audit_log.actor_id` points at profiles, and a
history whose actors have vanished is not a history. Deactivating is the way
out, and `current_user_role()` filters `is_active`, so a deactivated account
loses everything immediately — even with a session still in flight.

**There is no service key.** `/admin/users` calls Neon Auth's admin API with
the director's own session, and Neon Auth accepts it only from users whose auth
role is `admin`. That role is kept in step with `profiles.role`: only directors
hold it, a role change updates it, and deactivating an account bans it in Neon
Auth, which also ends its sessions. Without that, a demoted or deactivated
director could still reset other people's passwords by calling the auth API
directly — RLS never sees that call.

Public sign-up is disabled in Neon Auth (`disable_sign_up`), and the portal's
domain must be a trusted domain there, or every auth call fails with
`INVALID_ORIGIN`.

## Scripts

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | dev server |
| `npm run build` | production build |
| `npm test` | the regression suite — RLS, workflow triggers, guards, view arithmetic, formatting |
| `npm run test:watch` | the same, in watch mode |
| `npm run check` | `svelte-check` over the whole project |
| `npm run db:reset` | drop, re-migrate and re-seed the local database |
| `npm run db:types` | regenerate `src/lib/server/database.types.ts` from the local schema |

`npm test` runs against the local Supabase stack — start it first. It resets
its own fixture by truncating and replaying `supabase/seed.sql`, which takes
about 100ms, but it does **not** re-apply migrations: run `npm run db:reset`
once after changing the schema.

There is one more script, run by hand rather than by npm:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/import-ilj.ts <path-to-xlsx>
```

It parses ILJ's historical workbook into `supabase/seed-ilj.sql` for review. It
never writes to a database — see [docs/task/03-import-ilj.md](docs/task/03-import-ilj.md).

## Layout

## Status

| Screen | Route | State |
|---|---|---|
| Dasbor Eksekutif | `/` | built |
| Laporan P&L | `/entities` → `/entities/[id]/periods/[period]` | built |
| Input Laporan | `/entry/[period]` | built |
| Persetujuan | `/approval` | built |

All four screens exist and the sidebar has no disabled item. What is missing is
data rather than code: ILJ's nine real months are still an unrun parser, since
the source workbook is not in the repo. See
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

No deployment target is chosen yet, so `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` cannot detect
a platform and `npm run build` says so. Swap in a real adapter when that is
decided.
